To see all the audits captured for the HR user, type

SELECT EVENT_TIMESTAMP, CLIENT_PROGRAM_NAME, ACTION_NAME,
UNIFIED_AUDIT_POLICIES
FROM UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL
WHERE DBUSERNAME = 'HR'
ORDER BY EVENT_TIMESTAMP DESC;

You might see something like this:

EVENT_TIMESTAMP       CLIENT_PROG ACTION_NAME   UNIFIED_AUDIT_POLICY

 SELECT POLICY_NAME, AUDIT_OPTION, AUDIT_OPTION_TYPE

where policy_name = 'ORA_SECURECONFIG'
order by policy_name, AUDIT_OPTION;

 SELECT *

------------Audit all session connecting to the database:

audit create session [ whenever successful | whenever not successful ];

To audit sessions created by a specific user:
audit create session by SCOTT [ whenever successful | not successful ];

If you omit the condition "whenever successful/not successful", Oracle will audit all connections, regardless of their success or failure.


To disable auditing: 
noaudit create session;
noaudit create session by scott;

To verify that the auditing options has indeed been set:
SELECT * 
 FROM DBA_PRIV_AUDIT_OPTS 
 WHERE USER_NAME = 'SCOTT';
